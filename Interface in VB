In VB.NET, the interface is similar to a class for inheriting all properties, methods, and events that a class or structure can implement.
Using the interface in VB.NET, we can use multiple inheritances of classes. It uses the Implements keyword to "implement" the interfaces,
and the "Interface" keyword is used to create the interface. All interfaces in VB.NET starts with i.

Imports System
Module Program
    Interface A
        Sub Name()
    End Interface
    Class B : Implements A
        Public Sub Name() Implements A.Name
            Console.WriteLine("Hamar Naaam Ba Ramuwa")
        End Sub
    End Class

    Sub Main()
        Dim Obj = New B() or Dim obj As New B()
        Obj.Name()
    End Sub
End Module
