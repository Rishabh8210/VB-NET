What is an Exception?
An exception is an unwanted error that occurs during the execution of a program and can be a system exception or application exception.
Exceptions are nothing but some abnormal and typically an event or condition that arises during the execution, which may interrupt the normal flow of the program.
An exception can occur due to different reasons, including the following:

A user has entered incorrect data or performs a division operator, such as an attempt to divide by zero.
A connection has been lost in the middle of communication, or system memory has run out

Imports System
Module Program
    Sub Main()
        Dim x, y, z As Integer
        x = 10
        y = 0
        Try
            z = x \ y
            'syntax : Catch exception_name As Exception
        Catch pkdo As Exception
            Console.WriteLine("Exception aaya hai because we r dividing a no with 0")
            Console.WriteLine(pkdo) 'Exception msg Printing
        Finally
            Console.WriteLine("I don't care Exception aaye ya na aaye me chalunga")
        End Try
    End Sub
End Module
