'The With End Statement is not the same as a loop structure. It is used to access and execute statement on a
'specified object without specifying the name of the object with each statement. Within a With statement block, you
'can specify a member of an object that begins with a period (.) to detifine multiple statement

'Syntax:
'       With objExpression
'           Statements
'       End With

'objExpression :- It defines the data type of objectExpression. It may be any class or structure type or basic data
'                   type as Integer. It can be executed once in the With End statement
'Statement:- It defines one or more executed statements within the With block. The statement refers to the member
'               of the object that links with objExpression to execute the With statement block
'End With :- It is used to end the With block.

'Basically smjhe toh With End With koi loop ni h ye bs ek method hai class ka members ko access krne ka or operation
'perform krne ka ,ye bss ek hi barr chalega and (.) ki madad se easily member access kr skte
' "object." likhne ki jarurt ni hai
