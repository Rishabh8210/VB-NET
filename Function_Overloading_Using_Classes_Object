'In Visual Basic,Method Overloading means defining Multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters. By Using Method Overloading we can perform  
'Different tasks with the same methods name by passing different parameters...in VB it is also known as Compile time Ploymorphims or early Binding
'In VB.Net "Overloads" Keyword may be use to create Method Overloading  (class nd Object may use hoga without using v chalega)
